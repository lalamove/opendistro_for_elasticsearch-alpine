# opendistro_for_elasticsearch-alpine
OpenDistro Packaging in Alpine docker image based on github.com/blacktop/docker-elasticsearch-alpine

This is mainly an exercise in trying to open up Open Distro's packaging a bit, whilst simultaneously upgrading it to 6.6 and running it on Alpine using a jlinked JRE.
